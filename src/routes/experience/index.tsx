          As part of my master internship, I was awarded a research scholarship
          from FCT (the Portuguese public agency that supports science,
          technology and innovation). This enabled me to work independently
          while having the support of my supervisor. It was a great challenge
          that came with a lot of freedom, but also with huge responsibilities.
          The focus of this internship (and my dissertation) was to assess
          whether web applications were already a viable alternative to native
          ones in mobile devices. Based on this, I delivered my master thesis,
          which was a comparative study between web and native applications,

          In 2018, I built the credential platform for Queima das Fitas, one of
          the biggest festivals in Portugal - it enabled the creation of the
          credentials and included an application (in Flutter) to read the QR
          codes at the festivals' entrance. <br /> I have also built a{" "}
